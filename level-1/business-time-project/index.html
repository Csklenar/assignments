        <p>Sklenar's Skateshop was founded by Corey Sklenar, which is located in Edinburg, Texas. Corey grew up skating in the suburbs of Pickerington, Ohio at the age of 11. From what he recalls he always had a skateboard around since he was a little boy but stated taking it seriously when he was 11. Corey starting skateboarding 
            because his parents got him the Tony Hawk video games and the games always had skate videos show when you unlocked a new character. He thought the tricks that the pros were doing in these videos looked really cool and he wanted to learn. He started skateboarding every day, going to skateparks, and skating the streets of Pickerington.
            He became really good and would often teach his friends how to skate, he even lent them some of his boards so they could skate as well. When Corey was 21 he joined the Army, at this time he wasn't skateboarding hardly at all due to all the work he had to do in the Army, but he never stopped thinking about it. When he seperated from the
            Army when his contract ended in 2019 he opened up Sklenar's Skateshop in Edinburg, Texas. It serves as the best skateshop in the Rio Grande Valley and Corey always has skate videos on for the kids to watch while they are looking around the shop. His dream is for skateboarding to spread more across the valley so more kids can see how fun
            skateboarding is and to keep it growing.
